README - Sixlegs Java PNG Decoder

Features

  Supports all valid bit depths (grayscale/color), interlacing, paletted
  images, alpha channel/transparency, gamma correction, access to all
  standard chunks, private chunk handling, and progressive display.

Getting Started

  After including the javapng jar file in your classpath, typical usage
  is as follows:

  // create a new instance of PngImage
  com.sixlegs.png.PngImage png = new com.sixlegs.png.PngImage();

  // decode a PNG file into a BufferedImage using the read method
  java.awt.image.BufferedImage image =
    png.read(new java.io.File("test.png"));

  // the PngImage object will now provide access to the metadata
  int colorType = png.getColorType();
